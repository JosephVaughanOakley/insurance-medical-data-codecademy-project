Codecademy has assigned an open ended data analysis project using insurance medical data from kaggle.

In this project I have been tasked with using python alone to draw meaningful conclusions from the data provided.

Questions I intend to be able to answer:
- how much on average does smoking increase insurance costs?
- is there any correlation between BMI and number of children?
- is there any correlation between region and number of children?
- what is the average age of insured by region?
- does region have an impact on the cost of insuring children?
- is the cost-per-insured-child a flat rate or is it determined by other factors?
- is one sex more likely to smoke than the other?
- are people more likely to be smokers in one region than another?
- are males or females more likely to be smokers based on region?
- what generations are having more children? (will need to define generations)
