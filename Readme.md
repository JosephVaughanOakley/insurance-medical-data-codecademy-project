Codecademy has assigned an open ended data analysis project using insurance medical data from kaggle.

In this project I have been tasked with using python alone to draw meaningful conclusions from the data provided.

I intend to be able to answer questions such as:
- how much on average does smoking increase insurance costs? 
- is there any correlation between BMI and number of children?
- is there a relationship between BMI and insurance cost? what type of relationship?
- is there any correlation between region and number of children?
- what is the average age of insured by region?
- does region have an impact on the cost of insuring children?
- is the cost-per-insured-child a flat rate or is it determined by other factors?
- is one sex more likely to smoke than the other?
- are people more likely to be smokers in one region than another?
- are males or females more likely to be smokers based on region?
- what generations are having more children? (will need to define generations)


to get the most helpful data we need to control for other variables that affect cost, ie number of children, BMI bracket, age bracket, etc., but
the more we specify the criteria by which we group these records the smaller and smaller those sample sizes become. these smaller sample sizes
allow what would normally be a small variance in a large sample to have a disproportionate impact on the averages of the smaller sample, unrealistically
representing the whole (like gerrymandering, but not targeted).
